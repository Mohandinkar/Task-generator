## AI tools used
- ChatGPT
- Cursor IDE (AI-assisted coding)
- Antigravity

These tools were used to speed up development, scaffold components, and help with refactoring and debugging.  
All generated code was reviewed, modified, and tested manually before submission.

## What AI was used for
- Initial backend setup with Express
- Integrating Gemini API for task generation
- Generating structured JSON prompts for the LLM
- Creating React component structure
- Implementing task editing, grouping, and export logic
- Minor UI styling and layout improvements

## What I checked and verified myself
- API request/response flow between frontend and backend  
- JSON parsing from LLM responses  
- State management for tasks and grouping  
- Error handling for empty inputs and failed API calls  
- Markdown export functionality  
- Overall app flow and usability  

I tested all core features manually and ensured I understood how each part of the code works.

## LLM used
**Model:** Gemini 2.5 Flash  
**Provider:** Google Generative AI  

## Why this LLM
- Fast response time  
- Free tier available  
- Good structured JSON output  
- Easy Node.js integration  

It was suitable for generating user stories, tasks, and risks in a structured format for this small planning tool.
